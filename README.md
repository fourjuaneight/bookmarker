# Bookmarker

I like hoarding data online. This is how all that crap gets saved. It's a simple collection of scripts to parse, format, and upload bookmarks to Airtable. This is then deployed to a Cloudflare Worker. But can quickly be tweaked to work with Deno Deploy.

All code is self-documented. Aside from the specific names of bases and tables in Airtable, everything is easily portable and ready to fork. You'll just need to provide your environment variables.
